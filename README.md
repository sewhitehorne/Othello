# Othello
2D rendition of the Othello board game, written in Java and GUI implemented using Java Swing, with an AI computer player that uses MiniMax algorithm

WORK IN PROGRESS!

Current issues: label for current player is not updating/displaying correctly.

TO DO:

- Improve Eval function for minimax
- Implement alpha-beta
- Allow user to select player settings
- Use circles for discs instead of squares
- Implement save/load feature?
